    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p> Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people. </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chicken </b>– Chicken for a juicier lasagna.</li>
        <li><b>Onion </b>– we use yellow onion, or sweet onion works well</li>
        <li><b>Garlic cloves </b> – you can add more if you love garlic</li> 
        <li><b>Red wine </b>– This amps up the flavor of your sauce (avoid using cooking wine).</li>
        <li><b>Marinara sauce </b>– Use homemade marinara or store-bought.</li>
        <li><b>Dried thyme </b>– Italian seasoning, basil, or oregano can be substituted</li>
        <li><b>Sugar </b>– balances the acidity of the tomatoes</li>
        <li><b>Parsley </b>– flat-leaf or curly parsley works well</li>
        <li><b>Lasagna noodles </b>– Cook these al dente; they’ll continue to soften as the lasagna bakes.</li>
        <li><b>Cottage cheese </b>– adds great texture and moisture</li>
        <li><b>Ricotta cheese </b>– we use low-fat or part-skim ricotta</li>
        <li><b>Mozzarella cheese </b>– An Italian cheese blend works, but mozzarella is definitely the classic choice</li>
        <li><b>Egg </b>– helps hold the cheese layer together</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Brown the chicken </b>– Add oil to a deep pan and sautee 
            onion and beef until browned, 5 minutes then add garlic and stir another minute.</li>
        <li><b>Assemble </b>– Spread 1/2 cup of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9×13-inch casserole dish. 
            Add 3 noodles, followed by 1/3 of the meat sauce, 1 cup of mozzarella, and half of the 
            ricotta mixture. Repeat, then for the top layer, add 3 noodles, 1/3 of the meat sauce, 
            and the remaining mozzarella.</li>
    </ol>
